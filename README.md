## Solved Problems

    - NaN values on Touch -> remove touch functions as they won't work with Y values
    - Sizing on small mobile height -> @media of course
    - Background scrolling after opening menu -> turning off screens when menu is open
    - Viewer Resets DataSet and has trouble scrolling -> conditional return for phones and desktop
    - Big Title opacity reset on component change -> separate between a dynamic title for works, and a static title for other screens
    - Weird Bug with Style property randomly popping up -> condition check for existence before applying styles
    - flat surfaces -> box shadows

## Tips for Next Project

    - Build Dummy HTML first
    - Use External Arrays of Data
    - Don't seperate components too soon if you're doing spontaneous
    - Merge useStates if they have async behaviour
    - More animations for components
    - Be more creative
